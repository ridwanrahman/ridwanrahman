## About myself

Hi :wave: !
My name is Ridwan Rahman. I live in Melbourne where I very recently got my Master's degree in information technology from Monash University. My goal is to become a well rounded full stack developer with experience in front-end, back-end and devops.

I am looking to work on projects and improve my development skills. I love working with Python and Javascript.
